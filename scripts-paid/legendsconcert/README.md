# legendsConcert

The legendsConcert resource is a unique feature in FiveM that enhances the gaming experience by allowing players to interact with music-related props. This resource specifically enables players to place microphone stands anywhere within the game environment. This feature adds a layer of realism and immersion, as players can set up their own concert stages or impromptu performances, making the game more engaging and interactive.

The placeable microphone stands are not just static objects; they can be positioned according to the player's preference. Whether the player wants to set up a grand concert or a small gig, these stands can be placed accordingly. This flexibility allows for a wide range of creative possibilities, making each player's experience unique.
